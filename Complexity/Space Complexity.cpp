//Space is complexity defines how much size would a program need if it wants to run;
//int takes 4 bytes
//so if we have 3 int variables defined as v1,v2,v3 it will take 3*4=12 bytes of memory and that will be the size of program.
//Test
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int v1,v2,v3;
} 
//its giving 300+ bytes because of the comments we have in here
